description: "Sartor Resartus (meaning 'The tailor re-tailored') is an 1836 novel\
  \ by Thomas Carlyle, first published as a serial in 1833–34 in Fraser's Magazine.\
  \ The novel purports to be a commentary on the thought and early life of a German\
  \ philosopher called Diogenes Teufelsdröckh (which translates as 'god-born devil-dung'),\
  \ author of a tome entitled \"Clothes: Their Origin and Influence\", but was actually\
  \ a poioumenon. Teufelsdröckh's Transcendentalist musings are mulled over by a skeptical\
  \ English Reviewer (referred to as Editor) who also provides fragmentary biographical\
  \ material on the philosopher. The work is, in part, a parody of Hegel, and of German\
  \ Idealism more generally. However, Teufelsdröckh is also a literary device with\
  \ which Carlyle can express difficult truths.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
